      <p><b>History</b></p>
      <p>
        Throughout his life, Honda's founder, Soichiro Honda (1906–1991), had an
        interest in automobiles. He worked as a mechanic at the Art Shokai
        garage, where he tuned cars and entered them in races. In 1937, with
        financing from his acquaintance Kato Shichirō, Honda founded Tōkai Seiki
        (Eastern Sea Precision Machine Company) to make piston rings working out
        of the Art Shokai garage. After initial failures, Tōkai Seiki won a
        contract to supply piston rings to Toyota, but lost the contract due to
        the poor quality of their products. After attending engineering school
        without graduating, and visiting factories around Japan to better
        understand Toyota's quality control processes known as "Five whys", by
        1941 Honda was able to mass-produce piston rings acceptable to Toyota,
        using an automated process that could employ even unskilled wartime
        laborers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tōkai Seiki was placed under the control of the Ministry of Commerce and
        Industry (called the Ministry of Munitions after 1943) at the start of
        World War II, and Soichiro Honda was demoted from president to senior
        managing director after Toyota took a 40% stake in the company. Honda
        also aided the war effort by assisting other companies in automating the
        production of military aircraft propellers. The relationships Honda
        cultivated with personnel at Toyota, Nakajima Aircraft Company and the
        Imperial Japanese Navy would be instrumental in the postwar period. A US
        B-29 bomber attack destroyed Tōkai Seiki's Yamashita plant in 1944, and
        the Itawa plant collapsed on 13 January 1945 Mikawa earthquake. Soichiro
        Honda sold the salvageable remains of the company to Toyota after the
        war for ¥450,000 and used the proceeds to found the Honda Technical
        Research Institute in October 1946.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a staff of 12 men working in a 16 m2 (170 sq ft) shack, they built
        and sold improvised motorized bicycles, using a supply of 500 two-stroke
        50 cc Tohatsu war surplus radio generator engines. When the engines ran
        out, Honda began building their own copy of the Tohatsu engine, and
        supplying these to customers to attach to their bicycles. This was the
        Honda A-Type, nicknamed the Bata Bata for the sound the engine made. In
        1949, the Honda Technical Research Institute was liquidated for
        ¥1,000,000, or about US$5,000 today; these funds were used to
        incorporate Honda Motor Co., Ltd. At about the same time Honda hired
        engineer Kihachiro Kawashima, and Takeo Fujisawa who provided
        indispensable business and marketing expertise to complement Soichiro
        Honda's technical bent. The close partnership between Soichiro Honda and
        Fujisawa lasted until they stepped down together in October 1973.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first complete motorcycle with both the frame and engine made by
        Honda was the 1949 D-Type, the first Honda to go by the name Dream. In
        1961, Honda achieved its first Grand Prix victories and World
        Championships in the 125 cc and 250 cc categories. Honda Motor Company
        grew in a short time to become the world's largest manufacturer of
        motorcycles by 1964. The first production automobile from Honda was the
        T360 mini pick-up truck, which went on sale in August 1963. Powered by a
        small 356 cc straight-4 gasoline engine, it was classified under the
        cheaper Kei car tax bracket. The second production car from Honda was
        the S500 sports car, which followed the T360 into production in October
        1963. Its chain-driven rear wheels pointed to Honda's motorcycle
        origins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the next few decades, Honda worked to expand its product line,
        operations and exports to numerous countries around the world. In 1986,
        Honda introduced the successful Acura brand to the American market in an
        attempt to gain ground in the luxury vehicle market. The year 1991 saw
        the introduction of the Honda NSX supercar, the first all-aluminum
        monocoque vehicle that incorporated a mid-engine V6 with variable-valve
        timing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1990, CEO Tadashi Kume was succeeded by Nobuhiko Kawamoto. Kawamoto
        was selected over Shoichiro Irimajiri, who oversaw the successful
        establishment of Honda of America Manufacturing, Inc. in Marysville,
        Ohio. Irimajiri and Kawamoto shared a friendly rivalry within Honda;
        owing to health issues, Irimajiri would resign in 1992.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the death of Soichiro Honda and the departure of Irimajiri,
        Honda found itself quickly being outpaced in product development by
        other Japanese automakers and was caught off-guard by the truck and
        sport utility vehicle boom of the 1990s, all which took a toll on the
        profitability of the company. Japanese media reported in 1992 and 1993
        that Honda was at serious risk of an unwanted and hostile takeover by
        Mitsubishi Motors, which at the time was a larger automaker by volume
        and was flush with profits from its successful Pajero and Diamante
        models.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kawamoto acted quickly to change Honda's corporate culture, rushing
        through market-driven product development that resulted in recreational
        vehicles such as the first-generation Odyssey and the CR-V, and a
        refocusing away from some of the numerous sedans and coupes that were
        popular with the company's engineers but not with the buying public. The
        most shocking change to Honda came when Kawamoto ended the company's
        successful participation in Formula One after the 1992 season, citing
        costs in light of the takeover threat from Mitsubishi as well as the
        desire to create a more environmentally friendly company image.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Honda Aircraft Company as established in 2006 as a wholly owned
        subsidiary to manufacture and sell the HondaJet family of aircraft. The
        first deliveries to customers began in December 2015.
      </p>
      <p>
        On 23 February 2015, Honda announced that CEO and President Takanobu Ito
        would step down and be replaced by Takahiro Hachigo in June of that
        year; additional retirements by senior managers and directors were
        expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the fiscal year 2018, Honda reported earnings of US$9.534 billion,
        with an annual revenue of US$138.250 billion, an increase of 6.2% over
        the previous fiscal cycle. Honda's shares traded at over $32 per share,
        and its market capitalization was valued at US$50.4 billion in October
        2018.

        In October 2019, Honda was reported to be in talks with Hitachi to merge
        the two companies' car parts businesses, creating a components supplier
        with almost $17 billion in annual sales.
      </p>
      <p>
        In January 2020, Honda announced that it would be withdrawing employees
        working in the city of Wuhan, Hubei, China due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
        On 23 March 2020 due to the global spread of the virus, Honda became the
        first major automaker with operations in the US to suspend production in
        its factories. It resumed automobile, engine and transmission production
        at its US plants on 11 May 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        Honda and General Motors announced in September 2020 a North American
        alliance to begin in 2021. According to The Detroit Free Press, "The
        proposed alliance will include sharing a range of vehicles, to be sold
        under each company’s distinct brands, as well as cooperation in
        purchasing, research and development, and connected services."
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2021, Honda announced its intention to become the world's first
        carmaker to sell a vehicle with level 3 self-driving technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        In March 2022, Honda announced it would develop and build electric
        vehicles in a joint venture with Sony. The latter is set to provide its
        imaging, sensing, network and other technologies while Honda would be
        responsible for the car manufacturing processes. The venture is set to
        fully launch later in 2022 with the release of first cars scheduled for
        2025.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2023, Honda announced a deal with American car company General Motors
        to produce cars using a new hydrogen fuel system. The aim is to ramp up
        the hydrogen powered cells in their Electric vehicles as well as trucks,
        construction machinery, and power stations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2023, Honda recalled 500,000 vehicles in the United States and Canada
        due to an issue with seat belts in the car not latching correctly. Among
        the models recalled were the 2017-2020 CR-V, the 2018 and 2019 Accord,
        the 2018-2020 Odyssey, the 2019 Insight, and the Acura RDX from 2019 and
        2020. According to the recall, the seat belts in the front seats would
        break open on impact increasing the risk of injury in a crash.
      </p>
      <p>
        On 31 December 2023, Honda announced a global recall of about 4.5
        million vehicles, including 2.54 million in the U.S., over fuel pump
        failures, following earlier recalls in 2021 and 2020 for the same issue.
