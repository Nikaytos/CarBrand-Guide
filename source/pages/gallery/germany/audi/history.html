      <p><b>History</b></p>
      <p>
        Audi is one of the best-selling luxury automobile manufacturers in the
        world. However, the origins of the German brand are complex and
        colourful, to say the least. Behind the name of every car company,
        there’s a story. Sometimes it’s as simple as the name of the family who
        founded it (Bentley, for example), sometimes it’s an acronym for a
        phrase people don’t seem to remember. The story behind Audi, however, is
        that little bit more interesting. OSV takes a look at the rich history
        of the German brand in our Audi history.

        Audi was technically founded way back in 1885 when the Wanderer Company
        was established, later becoming a branch of Audi. But it was in 1899
        that August Horch established A. Horch & Cie in Cologne, then went on to
        form the August Horch & Cie. Motowagenwerke AG in 1904.However, this
        didn’t last for very long and Horch left Motowagenwerke in 1909,
        founding his own company August Horch Authomobilewerke GmbH. You may
        have noticed that all these company names sound very similar because his
        old company definitely did. They sued Horch for trademark infringement
        and the Supreme Court agreed. Horch then had to come up with a new name
        for his company. So, how did he get to Audi? Well, Horch in Latin is
        Audi, which means ‘to listen’. And thus, Audi was born. In April 1910
        Audi Automobilwerke GmbH Zwickau was officially created. From 1915, it
        was named Audiwerke AG Zwickau. Zwickau was of course where the company
        was located, which is in the state of Saxony.

        Audi as we now know it launched their first car in 1910 and was the Audi
        Type A Sport-Phaeton. It’s successor, the Type B was also launched that
        year. Both were successes, particularly in sporting events. Horch had
        led his team to three straight victories in the Austrian Alpine Run.It
        was in 1920 that Horch left Audi to take up a high position in the
        ministry of transport but in his short time at the manufacturer, he had
        made the brand internationally known. Shortly after he left, Audi became
        the first German car brand to produce a car that was left-hand drive,
        the Audi Type K. This became dominant in the 1920s due to the fact it
        gave drivers a better view of oncoming traffic. This, in turn, made it
        easier and safer to overtake.

        The Audi logo came about after a merger of four companies. In 1928,
        engineer Jørgen Rasmussen acquired majority shares in Audi. Soon, the
        company merged with Rasmussen’s DKW, Wanderer and Audi’s old competitor
        Horch to form the Auto Union in 1932. The merger led to the creation of
        the four interlocking rings.Funnily enough, this emblem was also similar
        to the Olympic Rings (which you’ve also probably noticed). So much so
        that the Olympic Committee eventually took them to court in 1995. The
        result was as you’d expect, the court ruled that the Audi rings had
        nothing to do with the Olympic rings. And so the two logos live in
        harmony.

        With the new partnership in place, technology became the focal point for
        Audi, something that has since remained central to the company’s
        corporate identity. In the early days of the Auto Union era, Audi became
        the first European car company to offer a six-cylinder-engine, front
        wheel drive model. This was the Audi Front. However, it wasn’t before
        long that concentration turned to the German war effort. The firm began
        producing armoured cars for the military. Of course, this made them
        prime targets for Allied bombing and this took its toll on
        production.After the war, Audi found their Zwickau factory deep inside
        the Soviet-influenced GDR and the Auto Union no longer a functioning
        entity. The factories were dismantled as part of the war reparations,
        under the orders of the Soviet military. In August 1948, Auto Union AG
        was deleted from the commercial register which essentially liquidated
        Germany’s Auto Union. Of course, that wasn’t the end. The Auto Union
        executives looked at relocating what they had left of the company to
        West Germany, where they set up a spare parts operation in Bavaria.
        Interestingly, the factory in Zwickau restarted assembly in 1949 and
        created cars for East Germany. It was in this factory that the Trabant
        was created. The Trabant was considered the symbol of East Germany and
        the fall of the Eastern Bloc. It was uncomfortable, noisy, slow, and
        extremely desirable in East Germany. The waiting time for the Trabant
        was more than a decade. Over three million of these were produced in
        total.
